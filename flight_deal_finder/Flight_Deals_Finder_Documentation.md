# Flight Deals Finder Documentation

## Overview

The Flight Deals Finder is a Python program designed to search for the cheapest flight deals from a specified origin airport to various destinations listed in a Google Sheet. It uses the Amadeus API to fetch flight information and updates the Google Sheet with IATA codes for cities. The program also sends notifications if a cheaper flight is found compared to a specified threshold.

## Components

The program consists of several main components, each defined in separate files:

1. `main.py` - The main script that orchestrates the program's execution.
2. `flight_search.py` - Contains the `FlightSearch` class responsible for interacting with the Amadeus API.
3. `flight_data.py` - Defines the `FlightData` class and the `find_cheapest_flight` function.
4. `data_manager.py` - Contains the `DataManager` class responsible for interacting with the Google Sheet via the Sheety API.

## Files and Classes

### `main.py`

The main script that ties everything together.

- **Setup:**
  - Creates instances of `DataManager` and `FlightSearch`.
  - Fetches destination data from the Google Sheet.
  - Sets the origin city IATA code (e.g., "LON" for London).

- **Update IATA Codes:**
  - Iterates over the destination data and updates any missing IATA codes using the `FlightSearch.get_destination_code` method.
  - Updates the Google Sheet with the new IATA codes.

- **Search for Flights:**
  - Defines the date range for the flight search (from tomorrow to six months from today).
  - For each destination, it checks for flights and identifies the cheapest one using `FlightSearch.check_flights` and `find_cheapest_flight`.
  - Prints notifications if a cheaper flight is found.

### `flight_search.py`

Handles interactions with the Amadeus API.

- **Class: `FlightSearch`**
  - **Attributes:**
    - `_api_key` and `_api_secret` for Amadeus API authentication.
    - `_token` to store the authentication token.
  - **Methods:**
    - `_get_new_token`: Fetches a new bearer token from the Amadeus API.
    - `get_destination_code`: Retrieves the IATA code for a given city.
    - `check_flights`: Searches for flights between the origin and destination cities within the specified date range.

### `flight_data.py`

Defines the structure for flight data and a function to find the cheapest flight.

- **Class: `FlightData`**
  - **Attributes:**
    - `price`: Flight price.
    - `origin_airport`: Origin airport IATA code.
    - `destination_airport`: Destination airport IATA code.
    - `out_date`: Departure date.
    - `return_date`: Return date.

- **Function: `find_cheapest_flight`**
  - Takes flight data and finds the flight with the lowest price.
  - Returns an instance of `FlightData`.

### `data_manager.py`

Handles interactions with the Google Sheet via the Sheety API.

- **Class: `DataManager`**
  - **Methods:**
    - `get_destination_data`: Fetches destination data from the Google Sheet.
    - `update_destination_codes`: Updates the Google Sheet with IATA codes for each city.

## How to Use

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary API keys for the Amadeus API and access to the Sheety API.
   - Update the `ORIGIN_CITY_IATA` in `main.py` with your desired origin city's IATA code.

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute `main.py`. The script will fetch destination data, update IATA codes, search for flights, and notify if cheaper flights are found.

3. **Dependencies:**
   - Install the required Python packages using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```

## Example

Here's a sample output of the program:

```
sheet_data:
 [{'city': 'Paris', 'iataCode': 'CDG', 'lowestPrice': 100, 'id': 1}, ...]

Getting flights for {'city': 'Paris', 'iataCode': 'CDG', 'lowestPrice': 100, 'id': 1}
Using this token to get destination YOUR_TOKEN
Status code 200. Airport IATA: ...
Lowest price to CDG is Â£90
Lower price flight found to Paris!
```
